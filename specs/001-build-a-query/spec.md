# Feature Specification: Query Execution User Interface for BigQuery

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-query`  
**Created**: September 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a query execution user interface that wraps BigQuery. The UI should address the following issues with the current BigQuery UI: high memory usage, poor use of screen real estate, lack of keyboard shortcuts, missing dark mode, unnecessary GCP panels, subpar autocomplete, and inadequate SQL formatting. The vision is a fast, VSCode-like interface where the code editor dominates the screen, panels are hideable via keyboard shortcuts, and the app is lightweight. Prioritize performance, keyboard navigation, dark mode, and a superior SQL editing experience."


## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A data analyst wants to write, execute, and iterate on SQL queries against BigQuery datasets in a fast, distraction-free, and keyboard-driven interface that feels familiar to code editors like VSCode.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the application, **When** they start typing a SQL query, **Then** the editor should provide responsive autocomplete and formatting.
2. **Given** the user is editing a query, **When** they press a keyboard shortcut, **Then** side panels (e.g., schema browser) should hide or show instantly.
3. **Given** the user executes a query, **When** the query completes, **Then** results should be displayed without significant delay or memory bloat.
4. **Given** the user prefers dark mode, **When** they toggle the theme, **Then** the UI should switch to a dark color scheme throughout.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a query returns a very large result set?
- How does the system handle BigQuery authentication errors?
- What if the user loses network connectivity during query execution?
- How does the UI behave on very small or very large screens?


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to write and execute SQL queries against BigQuery datasets.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a code editor interface where the editor occupies the majority of the screen.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to hide or show side panels (e.g., schema browser, results) using keyboard shortcuts.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support dark mode throughout the UI.
- **FR-005**: System MUST minimize memory usage and avoid unnecessary background processes.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide fast and relevant autocomplete for BigQuery SQL dialect.
- **FR-007**: System MUST format SQL queries according to best practices for BigQuery SQL.
- **FR-008**: System MUST avoid displaying unnecessary GCP panels (e.g., project selector, account selector, GCP search bar).
- **FR-009**: System MUST display query results quickly and efficiently, even for large datasets.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support keyboard navigation for all major actions (e.g., focus editor, run query, toggle panels).
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle authentication with BigQuery using OAuth.
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle error scenarios gracefully (e.g., network loss, query errors).

### Key Entities
- **Query**: Represents a SQL statement to be executed against BigQuery. Attributes: text, status, results, error.
- **User Session**: Represents the authenticated user context and preferences (e.g., theme, keyboard shortcuts).
- **Panel**: Represents UI components that can be shown/hidden (e.g., schema browser, results, settings).
