# Feature Specification: Integrate Basic Components

**Feature Branch**: `002-description-currently-all`  
**Created**: September 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "currently all basic component is created, but they are not yet integrated with each other. the routing, the wiring, etc."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the application components to be fully integrated so that I can navigate seamlessly and use all features without issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** all components are created, **When** the application is launched, **Then** the user should be able to navigate between components without errors.
2. **Given** a user interacts with a component, **When** the component triggers an action, **Then** the corresponding functionality should execute correctly.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component fails to load?
- How does the system handle navigation errors?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate all components (e.g., routing, wiring) to ensure seamless navigation.
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle errors gracefully when a component fails to load.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to interact with all components without encountering functionality issues.
- **FR-004**: System MUST log errors for debugging purposes.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure that all components are visually consistent.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Component**: Represents a UI module, key attributes include name, state, and dependencies.
- **Integration**: Represents the connection between components, key attributes include source, target, and status.
