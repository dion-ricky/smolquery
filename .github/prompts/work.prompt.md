# Work and verify task execution


Work on the task, implement as specified and create test cases (if any). After that, verify that the implementation is correct and all tests pass.

Given the task ID provided as an argument, do this:

1. Load `specs/{spec_id}/tasks.md` and locate the task by its ID.
2. Implement the task as described in the file.
3. Implement any necessary test cases to cover the new functionality.
4. Verify that the implementation in the codebase matches the task description.
5. Check for the presence of relevant test cases in the codebase.
6. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass successfully.
7. Update the checkbox in `specs/{spec_id}/tasks.md` to reflect completion if all checks pass. Only change the status if the task is fully verified. Do not change any other part of the file.
